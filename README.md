This app uses React Native to build a mobile app that fetches data from an external API. The app has four main screens: HomeScreen, ProductDetailScreen, CartScreen, and a Drawer component that provides navigation between screens.

The app uses AsyncStorage to store the cart data locally on the device. The cart data is stored as a JSON string in AsyncStorage.

The app uses a StackNavigator to navigate between screens, and a DrawerNavigator to provide a navigation drawer.

The app fetches data from the external API using axios, and manages asynchronous operations using async/await.
